# Complete Application Flow Documentation

This document explains the complete flow of how job applications work between users and companies in the Smart Placement System.

## 🔄 Application Flow Overview

```
User applies to job → Application stored in database → Company can view and manage applications
```

### Two Application Methods

#### Method 1: Platform-Based Applications (Recommended)
- Company creates job **without** `applyLink`
- Users apply through the platform's built-in application system
- Applications are stored in the database
- Companies can view and manage applications through the API
- Full application tracking and management features available

#### Method 2: External Applications
- Company creates job **with** `applyLink`
- Users are directed to external application page (company's website)
- Applications are handled externally by the company
- Limited tracking through the platform
- Companies may still use the platform for job posting and visibility

## 📋 Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Company Creates Job
```bash
POST /api/companies/jobs
```
- Company registers and logs in
- Company creates job posting with all details
- Job is automatically visible to users in the Flutter app
- Job gets `companyId` reference linking it to the company
- **applyLink is optional**: 
  - If provided: Users are directed to external application page
  - If not provided: Users apply through the platform's built-in system

### 2. User Applies to Job
```bash
POST /api/job-applications
```
- User sees job in Flutter app
- User applies with resume, cover letter, and additional details
- Application is stored in `JobApplication` collection
- Application includes `userId` and `jobId` references

### 3. Company Views Applications
```bash
GET /api/companies/applications
```
- Company can see all applications for their job postings
- Applications include full user profile information
- Company can filter by status, job, pagination, etc.

### 4. Company Manages Applications
```bash
PATCH /api/companies/applications/:id/status
```
- Company can update application status (pending → reviewed → shortlisted → hired/rejected)
- Company can add notes for each status change
- All actions are tracked with timestamps

## 🗄️ Database Structure

### Collections Involved

1. **Companies Collection**
   - Stores company information
   - Links to jobs via `companyId`

2. **Jobs Collection**
   - Stores job postings
   - Has `companyId` field linking to company
   - Visible to users for applications

3. **Users Collection**
   - Stores user profiles
   - Links to applications via `userId`

4. **JobApplications Collection**
   - Links users to jobs they applied for
   - Stores application details and status
   - Tracks company actions

### Relationships
```
Company (1) ──── (N) Jobs (1) ──── (N) JobApplications (N) ──── (1) User
```

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### User Authentication
- Users use JWT tokens with `type: 'user'`
- Can apply to any active job
- Can view their own applications

### Company Authentication
- Companies use JWT tokens with `type: 'company'`
- Can only view applications for their own job postings
- Can manage applications for their jobs

## 📊 Company Dashboard Features

Companies get comprehensive statistics:

### Job Statistics
- Total jobs posted
- Active vs inactive jobs
- Recent job postings (last 30 days)

### Application Statistics
- Total applications received
- Applications by status (pending, reviewed, shortlisted, hired, rejected)
- Recent applications (last 7 days)

### Analytics Charts
- Jobs by domain
- Jobs by education level
- Applications by status

### Company Side (Web Dashboard/Admin Panel)
1. **Job Management**: Companies manage their job postings
2. **Application Review**: Companies review incoming applications
3. **Status Updates**: Companies update application statuses
4. **Analytics**: Companies view application statistics

## 🔄 Application Status Flow

```
pending → reviewed → shortlisted → hired
    ↓         ↓           ↓         ↓
  rejected  rejected   rejected  rejected
```

### Status Meanings
- **pending**: Application received, not yet reviewed
- **reviewed**: Application has been reviewed by company
- **shortlisted**: Candidate selected for interview/next round
- **rejected**: Application rejected at any stage
- **hired**: Candidate successfully hired

   # Tech Labs creates ML Engineer job
   POST /api/companies/jobs
   ```

2. **User Application**
   ```bash
   # John Doe sees job in Flutter app
   # John applies to the job
   POST /api/job-applications
   ```

3. **Company Review Process**
   ```bash
   # Tech Labs views all applications
   GET /api/companies/applications
   
   # Tech Labs reviews John's application
   GET /api/companies/applications/john_app_id
   
   # Tech Labs shortlists John
   PATCH /api/companies/applications/john_app_id/status
   # Body: {"status": "shortlisted", "notes": "Strong technical background"}
   
   # After interview, Tech Labs hires John
